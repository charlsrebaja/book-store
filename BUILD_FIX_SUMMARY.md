# Build Error Fix - Summary

## Problem

Build error occurred during Vercel deployment:

```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/admin/orders/[id]
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing GET handlers** in dynamic API routes (`/api/admin/orders/[id]` and `/api/admin/users/[id]`)
2. **Database connection issues** during build time
3. **Prisma Client not generated** before Next.js build
4. **Google OAuth credentials** causing issues when not configured

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added GET Handlers to Dynamic Routes

**File: `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts`**

- Added GET method to fetch a single order by ID
- Maintains authentication and authorization checks
- Returns order with user and items details

**File: `app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`**

- Added GET method to fetch a single user by ID
- Maintains admin-only access control
- Returns user details (excluding sensitive data)

### 2. Updated Prisma Configuration

**File: `lib/prisma.ts`**

- Improved database connection handling
- Conditionally set logging based on environment
- Explicitly configured datasource URL

### 3. Updated Build Scripts

**File: `package.json`**

- Modified `build` script: `"build": "prisma generate && next build"`
- Added `postinstall` script: `"postinstall": "prisma generate"`
- Ensures Prisma Client is always generated before building

### 4. Made Google OAuth Optional

**File: `lib/auth.ts`**

- Google provider is only added if `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set
- Prevents build errors when Google OAuth is not configured
- Credentials provider still works independently

### 5. Created Environment Documentation

**Files created:**

- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added build error fixes section

## Testing the Fix

### Local Test

Run the following commands to test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma Client
npm run prisma:generate

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Generate using: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your production URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (optional)
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional)

2. **Deploy:**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Vercel will automatically detect the changes
   - Build should now succeed

## Environment Variables Required

### Mandatory

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### Optional

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

## What Changed

### Before

- Dynamic API routes only had PUT and DELETE methods
- Build process tried to pre-render routes without proper handlers
- Google OAuth was required, causing failures if not configured
- Prisma Client generation was separate from build

### After

- All dynamic routes have GET, PUT, and DELETE methods
- Routes are marked as `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to prevent pre-rendering
- Google OAuth is optional and gracefully handled
- Prisma Client is automatically generated during build

## Next Steps

1. âœ… All fixes have been applied to the codebase
2. ðŸ”„ Commit and push changes to GitHub
3. ðŸš€ Redeploy on Vercel (automatic if connected)
4. âœ… Verify deployment succeeds
5. ðŸ§ª Test API endpoints in production

## Additional Notes

- All API routes use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to prevent static optimization
- Database connections are properly handled during build time
- The app uses PostgreSQL (Neon) instead of MySQL
- Cloudinary is used for image uploads
- NextAuth handles authentication with JWT strategy
