# Featured Books Implementation Guide

## Overview

A complete Featured Books system has been implemented with database support and admin controls. This allows you to mark specific books as "featured" and display them dynamically on the homepage.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update ✅

- Added `isFeatured` boolean field to the `Book` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Default value is `false`
- Database schema has been pushed to the database

### 2. New API Endpoint ✅

- Created `/api/books/featured/route.ts`
- Fetches all books where `isFeatured = true`
- Orders by rating (desc) and creation date (desc)
- Only shows books that are in stock
- Supports limit parameter (default: 8 books)

### 3. Admin Panel Updates ✅

- Updated `app/admin/books/page.tsx`:
  - Added `isFeatured` field to the Book interface
  - Added featured checkbox in the book creation/edit form
  - Added "Featured" column in the books table
  - Books marked as featured show a 🏆 badge in the table
  - Beautiful toggle UI with descriptive text

### 4. Homepage Featured Books Component ✅

- Updated `components/FeaturedBooks.tsx`:
  - Changed from fetching bestsellers to fetching featured books
  - Now uses `/api/books/featured` endpoint
  - Maintains all existing functionality (slider, responsive, Add to Cart, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Stop the Development Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`

### Step 2: Generate Prisma Client

Run this command to regenerate the Prisma client with the new schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Seed Featured Books

If you want to mark some existing books as featured manually in the database, you can use Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Then navigate to the Book model and check the `isFeatured` checkbox for the books you want to feature.

## How to Use

### For Admins:

1. **Go to Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to `/admin/books`
2. **Create New Book or Edit Existing**
   - Click "Add New Book" or "Edit" on an existing book
3. **Feature the Book**
   - In the form, you'll see a checkbox labeled "🏆 Feature this Book"
   - Check this box to make the book appear in the Featured Books section
   - The description explains: "This book will appear in the Featured Books section on the homepage"
4. **Save**
   - Click "Create Book" or "Update Book"
   - The book will immediately appear in the Featured Books slider on the homepage

5. **View Featured Status**
   - In the books table, there's now a "Featured" column
   - Featured books show a 🏆 badge
   - Non-featured books show a dash (-)

### For Users:

1. **Homepage Featured Books**
   - The "Featured Books" section on the homepage now shows only books marked as featured by admins
   - Books are sorted by rating (highest first)
   - Only in-stock books are displayed
   - All slider functionality remains (manual navigation, responsive breakpoints, Add to Cart)

## Features

### Multiple Featured Books Support ✅

- Yes! You can feature as many books as you want
- The slider will display up to 8 featured books (configurable via API limit parameter)
- All featured books show in the slider with pagination dots for navigation

### Integration with Existing System ✅

- Fully integrated with existing book listings
- Works with existing cart system
- Compatible with existing admin panel
- No breaking changes to other features

### Dynamic Updates ✅

- When you mark/unmark a book as featured in admin panel, it immediately reflects on the homepage
- No manual configuration needed
- Automatic filtering of out-of-stock books

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints:

- `GET /api/books/featured` - Returns all featured books (in stock only)
  - Query params: `limit` (optional, default: 8)

### Database:

- Field: `isFeatured` (Boolean, default: false)
- Location: `Book` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`

### Admin Controls:

- Location: Admin > Books > Add/Edit Book Form
- UI: Checkbox with descriptive label and icon
- Visual feedback in table with badge

## Troubleshooting

### Featured Books Not Showing?

1. Make sure at least one book is marked as `isFeatured = true`
2. Ensure the book has stock > 0
3. Check browser console for any API errors
4. Verify Prisma client was regenerated after schema changes

### "isFeatured does not exist" Error?

- This means Prisma client hasn't been regenerated
- Stop dev server, run `npx prisma generate`, restart server

### Changes Not Reflecting?

- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check if dev server restarted properly

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Consider adding:

- Featured books priority/order field
- Featured date range (start/end dates)
- Featured books analytics
- Bulk feature/unfeature actions
- Featured books limit in admin settings
