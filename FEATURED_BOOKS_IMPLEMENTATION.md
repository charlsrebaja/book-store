### 1. API Endpoint

**File:** `app/api/books/bestsellers/route.ts`

Fetches top 8 bestselling books based on:

- Highest rating first
- Most reviews second
- Only books in stock (stock > 0)

```typescript
GET / api / books / bestsellers;
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "clx1234",
    "title": "Book Title",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "price": 19.99,
    "imageUrl": "https://...",
    "rating": 4.8,
    "reviews": 156
  }
]
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Data Flow

1. Component mounts → API call to `/api/books/bestsellers`
2. Shows loading skeleton while fetching
3. Receives top 8 books from database
4. Renders Swiper slider with book cards
5. Auto-plays every 4 seconds

### Database Query

```typescript
prisma.book.findMany({
  take: 8,
  orderBy: [{ rating: "desc" }, { reviews: "desc" }],
  where: {
    stock: { gt: 0 },
  },
});
```

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

```javascript
breakpoints={{
  640: {
    slidesPerView: 2,
    spaceBetween: 20,
  },
  1024: {
    slidesPerView: 3,
    spaceBetween: 24,
  },
  1280: {
    slidesPerView: 4,
    spaceBetween: 24,
  },
}}
