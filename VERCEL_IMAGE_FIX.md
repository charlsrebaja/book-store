# üö® URGENT FIX: Images Not Showing on Vercel

## The Problem

Your images work locally but don't show after deploying to Vercel because:

1. ‚úÖ Your code is correct (stores full Cloudinary URLs)
2. ‚úÖ Your `next.config.js` is correct
3. ‚ùå **Missing environment variable in Vercel** (even though you don't use it in image URLs, Next.js still needs it for configuration)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE FIX (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click your **bookshop** project
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add these 3 variables:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: drrtvz6sl
‚úì Production  ‚úì Preview  ‚úì Development

Name: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
Value: 773341824149577
‚úì Production  ‚úì Preview  ‚úì Development

Name: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
Value: nhxIUq1zTgOBWmyYPxWGYNb6dEw
‚úì Production  ‚úì Preview  ‚úì Development
```

**IMPORTANT:** Check ALL THREE environment boxes!

---

### Step 2: Verify Your Database Image URLs

Your images should be stored as **full URLs** in the database:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/drrtvz6sl/image/upload/v1761128415/readify/books/fxywya96efkwwg270wbc.webp
```

This is correct! ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding environment variables, you **MUST** redeploy:

**Option A - Trigger Automatic Redeploy:**

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy for Cloudinary env vars"
git push origin main
```

**Option B - Manual Redeploy in Vercel:**

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **‚ãÆ** (three dots) on latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**

---

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables Loaded

After deployment, visit:

```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-cloudinary
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "cloudName": "drrtvz6sl",
  "hasApiKey": true,
  "hasApiSecret": true,
  "nodeEnv": "production"
}
```

‚ùå If `cloudName` shows `"NOT SET"`, you didn't add the variable correctly!

### 2. Test Direct Image URL

Open this in your browser:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/drrtvz6sl/image/upload/v1761128415/readify/books/fxywya96efkwwg270wbc.webp
```

Should show your image ‚úÖ

### 3. Check Your Deployed Site

1. Open your deployed site
2. Go to Books page
3. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
4. Go to **Network** tab
5. Filter by **Img**
6. Look for Cloudinary images - should have **200 status**

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Images Still Don't Show After Adding Variables

**Solution:**

1. Clear Vercel cache: Delete `.vercel` folder locally
2. Redeploy with `--force` flag
3. Or manually trigger redeploy in Vercel dashboard

### Issue 2: 403 Forbidden Error

**Solution:**

1. Go to Cloudinary console
2. Check image upload settings
3. Ensure images are **public**, not private

### Issue 3: Mixed Content Error (HTTP/HTTPS)

**Solution:** Already fixed - your URLs use `https://` ‚úÖ

### Issue 4: CORS Error

**Solution:** Your `middleware.ts` already handles this ‚úÖ

## üìã Checklist Before Marking as Fixed

- [ ] Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` in Vercel
- [ ] Added `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` in Vercel
- [ ] Added `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` in Vercel
- [ ] Checked ALL THREE environment boxes
- [ ] Triggered redeploy
- [ ] Tested `/api/test-cloudinary` endpoint
- [ ] Verified cloudName returns `"drrtvz6sl"`
- [ ] Opened Books page on production
- [ ] Images are visible
- [ ] No 403/404 errors in Network tab

---

## üéØ Why This Happens

Even though your image URLs are **full URLs** and don't need the environment variable at runtime, Next.js Image component and the build process still check:

1. **During build**: Next.js validates `remotePatterns` in `next.config.js`
2. **At runtime**: Next.js needs to verify the hostname is allowed
3. **Image optimization**: Next.js uses these settings for CDN optimization

Your code is storing full URLs (which is good!), but Next.js still needs the environment variables configured for the Image Optimization API to work properly.

## üîë Key Points

‚úÖ **Your current setup:**

- Database stores: `https://res.cloudinary.com/drrtvz6sl/image/upload/v1761128415/readify/books/image.webp`
- Code renders: `<Image src={book.imageUrl} ... />`
- This is the **correct approach**!

‚úÖ **What's configured:**

- `next.config.js` has correct `remotePatterns`
- `middleware.ts` has correct CSP headers
- Image upload API works correctly

‚ùå **What's missing:**

- Environment variables in Vercel production

---

## üéâ After Fix

Once you complete the 3 steps above:

1. Images will load instantly ‚úÖ
2. No code changes needed ‚úÖ
3. No database changes needed ‚úÖ
4. Everything just works ‚úÖ

## üí° Pro Tip: Test Environment Variables

Add this to any client component temporarily:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Cloud Name:", process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME);
  console.log(
    "Sample URL:",
    `https://res.cloudinary.com/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME}/image/upload/sample.jpg`
  );
}, []);
```

Check browser console - should output:

```
Cloud Name: drrtvz6sl
Sample URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/drrtvz6sl/image/upload/sample.jpg
```

---

## üìû Still Not Working?

If images still don't show after following ALL steps:

1. **Screenshot the Vercel environment variables page** - verify they're set
2. **Check deployment logs** in Vercel for any errors
3. **Share the Network tab screenshot** showing failed image requests
4. **Verify the test endpoint** returns correct cloudName

The issue is 99% that environment variables aren't set correctly in Vercel!
