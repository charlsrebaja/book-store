# Featured Books Checkbox Fix - Final Steps

## ✅ Code Changes Completed

All necessary code changes have been made:

1. **Updated API endpoint** (`/api/books/[id]/route.ts`) - Now includes `isFeatured` field in UPDATE operations
2. **Fixed Featured Books API** (`/api/books/featured/route.ts`) - Now filters by `isFeatured: true`
3. **Admin form already working** - The checkbox is properly connected to formData
4. **Homepage component updated** - Uses the correct featured books endpoint

## 🔧 Required Action: Regenerate Prisma Client

The Prisma client needs to be regenerated to recognize the new `isFeatured` field. Here's how:

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)

1. **Stop the dev server** if running:
   - Find the terminal running `npm run dev`
   - Press `Ctrl + C`

2. **Regenerate Prisma client:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: If Dev Server Won't Stop

1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
2. Find all "Node.js" processes
3. Right-click → End Task on each one
4. Then run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

Once the Prisma client is regenerated and the server is restarted:

### Test Adding Featured Book:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/books`
2. Click "Add New Book"
3. Fill in the form
4. ✅ **Check "🏆 Feature this Book"**
5. Click "Create Book"
6. Go to homepage - the book should appear in Featured Books slider

### Test Editing Featured Status:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/books`
2. Click "Edit" on any book
3. Toggle the "Feature this Book" checkbox
4. Click "Update Book"
5. Check the homepage - featured status should update immediately

### Test Unfeaturing:

1. Edit a featured book
2. ✅ **Uncheck "🏆 Feature this Book"**
3. Click "Update Book"
4. The book should disappear from the Featured Books slider on homepage

- Verify the book has `stock > 0`
